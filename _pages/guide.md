Conducting research can be a complex process that requires various tools to enhance efficiency and quality of your work, all while preserving your valuable time. Below is a list of tools and tips based on my personal experience during my doctoral program.

## Principle

When selecting a tool from a range of options, choose one that offers multiple functionalities. Such tools allow us to learn once while being able to use them for a variety of tasks.

## AMAS framework

Research revolves around the pursuit of knowledge and involves various activities, from gathering information to making original contributions. Each of these tasks must be completed within specified time constratins, which makes prompt execution essential. To maximize efficiency, it is crucial to leverage technology effectively. The AMAS framework (Acquiring, Managing, Authoring, and Sharing) provides a straightforward approach to streamline your research workflow and enhance productivity.

### Acquiring knowledge

Data sources

- Bibliographic database

  - [Web of science](https://www.webofscience.com/): It is a primary source of data for conducting bibliometric analysis from [Clarivate](https://clarivate.com/). _It requires a subscription to access it_.
  - [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/search/form.uri?display=basic#basic): Research article database from [Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/). _It requires a subscription to access it_.

- Bibliographic software

  - [VOSviewer](https://www.vosviewer.com/): Basic network analyais and visualization
  - [Gephi](https://gephi.org/): Advanced network analyais and visualization
  - [Bibliometrix](https://www.bibliometrix.org): R package

- Machine learning

  - [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/): General dataset search engine with various useful metadata of dataset.
  - [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets): Various dataset for validating the performance of machine learning algorithms.
  - [Federal Reserve Economic Data](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/): Economic dataset 
  - [Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer](https://www.cancerrxgene.org/): Cancer drugs,cell lines, and drug response data. Useful for medical machine learning research.

### Managing knowledge

Reference management

- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/): Zotero is an essential tool to manage references while preparing research manuscripts. It is particularly helpful tool for oranizing knowledge. I successfully managed over 2,000 references easily while working on my manuscripts and doctoral dissertation. Zotero can handle various types of data, including academic papers, websites, and even YouTube video URLs, allowing you to organize all related information in one place. It functions as a virtual folder that keeps different data items together. If you are already familiar with EndNote, learning how to use Zotero will be a piece of cake. For tutorials, simply search for `zotero site:.edu` on Google.

### Authoring knowledge

Writing R/Python codes

- [MS Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): It allows us to author documents, Python, and R source code in a single editing environment. Of course, this website was authored with [MS Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Authoring high quality vector graphics

- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/): This tool can manipulate vector graphics using a simple user interface to generate high-quality graphic arts for an academic manuscript. Almost all academic journals require an author to submit figures in [vector graphic format](https://www.elsevier.com/journals/technological-forecasting-and-social-change/0040-1625/guide-for-authors) to maintain the quality of pictures in the paper.

### Sharing knowledge

Research articles

- Conference: Submit your preliminary results to the conference for peer review by other researchers.

Reusable R/Python codes

- [Github](https://github.com/): It is not only for source code, but also for sharing text information using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) feature. This website is also created using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). In other words, it is a free website platform.

## Dissemination

-	**Message must be delivered!** The oral presentation is the key skill to deliver your idea to the people who need it. Here is a great example of how to touch people's hearts without touching them physically.
